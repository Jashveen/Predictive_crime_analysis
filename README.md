# Crime Analysis

Welcome to the Crime Analysis project, a submission for the Karnataka State Police Hackathon! ðŸš¨ðŸ”Ž

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive solution aimed at assisting the Karnataka State Police in managing and analyzing crime data. It is built using Flask and includes separate authentication systems for police and regular users. The project also features distinct dashboards for both user types to facilitate seamless communication between the police and citizens.

## Key Features

### Police Dashboard

The police dashboard is the heart of the Crime Analysis project. It offers the following functionalities:

1. **Enter Record**: This feature allows police personnel to regularly update the crime database, ensuring that spatial analysis remains current and accurate.

2. **Search Record**: The search option enables police to quickly and efficiently look up records within the existing database.

3. **Crime Analysis**: This major feature provides a platform for spatial analysis of crime data, both at the state and district levels.

### User Dashboard

In addition to the police dashboard, we have developed a user dashboard as an added feature. This dashboard serves as a communication bridge between the police and citizens, fostering a safer and more connected community.

## Future Enhancements

We are continuously working on improving the Crime Analysis project. Some upcoming features include:

- AI Integration: We are planning to integrate AI capabilities to enhance the predictive and analytical power of our platform.
- Beat-wise Resource Allotment: This feature will help in optimal allocation of resources based on crime patterns and trends.

We hope that the Crime Analysis project will prove to be a valuable tool for the Karnataka State Police in their mission to serve and protect the community.
